# OCWS Bugs & Security Issues

## Shell Rendering Backends

Two parallel Zig shell implementations exist under `src/shells/`:

| Shell | Renderer | Dependencies | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zigshell-cairo-pango/` | Cairo + Pango + librsvg | cairo, pango, glib, gobject, librsvg | Baseline — working |
| `zigshell-blend2d/` | Blend2D (software JIT) | blend2d (vendored) | Initial build — needs polish |

Both share `toplevel.zig`, protocol files, and the same Wayland layer-shell architecture.
The goal is to keep `zigshell-cairo-pango` as the stable baseline while developing
`zigshell-blend2d` as the modern, glib-free replacement.

---

## De-duplication & Refactoring (shared code across shells)

Investigation found the two shells carried byte-identical copies of protocol and
utility code, plus dead directories/files. Extraction target: a single shared
module `src/shells/shared/` registered as the `shellcore` import in each
`build.zig`. Implemented: **the safe de-dup / dead-code half**; backlog: the
render/widget unification half (higher risk, backend-divergent).

### Implemented in this pass (✅ builds + tests green on both shells)
- [x] **P1-1 Shared `toplevel.zig`** — reconciled cairo (`hover_anim`) + blend2d
  (robust `add`/`removeAt`) into `src/shells/shared/toplevel.zig` with tests;
  deleted per-shell copies; imports now `@import("shellcore").toplevel`.
  `add()` returns `0` at capacity (matches existing blend2d test contract).
- [x] **P1-2 Shared `damage.zig`** — identical duplicate collapsed into
  `src/shells/shared/damage.zig`; per-shell copies deleted.
- [x] **P1-3 Shared protocol sources** — 3 byte-identical `.c/.h` protocol pairs
  (md5-confirmed triplicates) moved to `src/shells/shared/protocol/`; duplicates
  in both shells + the dead `src/shells/zigshell-core/` directory removed. Both
  `build.zig` `addProtocolSources` + include paths point at `../shared/protocol`.
- [x] **P1-4 Dead code removal** — deleted unused `panel_draw.c`/`panel_draw.h`
  from `zigshell-blend2d` (never linked into a live target); dropped their
  `addCSourceFile` calls and the `#include "panel_draw.h"` in `dock_c.h`;
  `panel_draw_test.zig` re-pointed at the live renderer (comment corrected).
- [x] **Module wiring** — `shellcore` `b.createModule` registered on `root_mod`
  and every test module in both `build.zig` files.

### Backlog (not yet implemented — render/widget unification, higher risk)
- [ ] **P0-1 Shared `Widget` struct** — structs are identical except the backend
  draw-fn param (`*c.cairo_t` vs `*blend2d.BlendRenderer`). Extract a generic
  `Widget(comptime Ctx)` or split field-data from render-fn pointers so
  `panel.zig` widget logic (measure/update/click/key) lives once.
- [ ] **P0-2 Shared widget logic** — `panel.zig` is ~1.3k lines duplicated per
  shell; only `draw_fn` bodies differ. Move measure/update/click/kbUpdate/etc.
  into a shared module parameterized over the renderer.
- [ ] **P2-1 Shared Wayland/layer-shell setup** — `main_shell.zig` registry bind,
  seat/keyboard/pointer listeners, and layer-shell config are near-identical.
- [ ] **P2-2 Shared config parsing** — `parseWidgetType` and config loading are
  duplicated.
- [ ] **P3-1 Shared `dock.zig`** — dock layout/logic largely overlaps; only draw
  differs.

⚠️ Note: an external `.mimocode` process periodically rewrites files under
`src/shells/` (observed reverting `build.zig` and dropping `panel.zig` fields
such as `key_fn`/`name`). Re-verify builds after edits; treat the on-disk
version as the live baseline.

## lxqt-panel Feature Extraction (enrich both zigshell backends)

Source of truth: `sources/lxqt-panel/plugin-*` (23 plugins). Goal: port the
most useful panel widgets into **both** `zigshell-cairo-pango` and
`zigshell-blend2d` (each widget is render-agnostic — only `draw_fn` differs;
`measure/update/click` logic is shared). Implemented: **7 of 14** (the
high-value / low-effort half). Backlog: 7 (the high-effort / D-Bus-heavy half).

### Implemented in this pass (▶ = done in both renderers)
- [x] **Spacer + stretch** (`plugin-spacer`) — flexible spacer so widgets can be centered/right-pushed, not just hard left/right. Files: `panel.zig` (`spacer` WidgetType + `spacerMeasure`).
- [x] **Keyboard layout indicator** (`plugin-kbindicator`) — show current XKB layout, click cycles via `setxkbmap`. Files: `panel.zig` (`kbindicator`, `kbUpdate`, `kbDraw`, `kbClick`).
- [x] **Custom command widget** (`plugin-customcommand`) — run a shell command on interval, render its stdout. One generic widget unlocks weather/now-playing/etc. Files: `panel.zig` (`customcommand`, `ccUpdate`, `ccDraw`, `ccClick`).
- [x] **Show Desktop button** (`plugin-showdesktop`) — minimize-all via `wlrctl`/toplevel. Files: `panel.zig` (`showdesktop`, `sdClick`).
- [x] **World clock** (`plugin-worldclock`) — multi-timezone clocks (per-widget `TZ`). Files: `panel.zig` (`worldclock`, `wcUpdate`, `wcDraw`).
- [x] **Backlight widget** (`plugin-backlight`) — read `/sys/class/backlight/*`, show bar + %, click adjusts via `brightnessctl`. Files: `panel.zig` (`backlight`, `blUpdate`, `blDraw`, `blClick`).
- [x] **Network throughput monitor** (`plugin-networkmonitor`) — upgrade the existing static `network` widget to live ↓/↑ KB/s + sparkline from `/proc/net/dev`. Files: `panel.zig` (`netUpdate`, `netDraw` + new Widget fields `net_rx_prev`, `net_tx_prev`, `net_hist_*`, `net_iface`).

### Backlog (not yet implemented)
- [ ] **System tray / Status Notifier** (`plugin-statusnotifier`) — app indicators via `StatusNotifierWatcher` D-Bus. Biggest missing UX piece; highest effort.
- [ ] **Mount / devices** (`plugin-mount`) — UDisks2/Solid mount/unmount/eject from panel.
- [ ] **lm-sensors multi-sensor** (`plugin-sensors`) — extend `temp` to poll `libsensors` for CPU/GPU/fan.
- [ ] **Volume mixer popup** (`plugin-volume`) — per-app sink list + scroll-to-adjust + popup.
- [ ] **Taskbar grouped labels** (`plugin-taskbar`) — grouped, labeled buttons (minimize/maximize/close) vs bare icons.
- [ ] **Directory menu** (`plugin-directorymenu`) — quick file-browser popup.
- [ ] **Fancy/main app menu** (`plugin-fancymenu`, `plugin-mainmenu`) — in-panel XDG category menu replacing `fuzzel`-only launcher.

### Notes
- New widgets share the existing `Widget` contract: `measure_fn` / `draw_fn` / `update_fn` / `click_fn`.
- `update_fn` is driven once per second by the timer in `main_shell.zig` (`widgetListUpdate`).
- Defaults list in `widgetCreateDefault()` was extended; config parser `parseWidgetType()` (cairo-pango) gained the new names.
- **Status (2026-07-16):** all 7 implemented in both `zigshell-cairo-pango` and `zigshell-blend2d`.
  `zig build` passes for both renderers (panel.zig + new widget code compile cleanly).
  cairo-pango `zig build test` passes. blend2d `zig build test` has a **pre-existing**
  build.zig gap (the `dock_test` module is missing `link_libc`/include paths) — not
  related to the new widgets; main build is green.

## Future Development Roadmap (cross-shell)

Derived from the lxqt-panel extraction review. Covers both `zigshell-cairo-pango`
(baseline) and `zigshell-blend2d` (target). The blend2d-specific Phases 1–8 in the
next section remain authoritative for blend2d-only detail (SVG, C migration, eval).
This section tracks the items that apply to **both** shells so progress is visible
in one place. 14 concrete roadmap items → implementing the first **7** (non-D-Bus
infrastructure) now; the remaining 7 (D-Bus-heavy / large refactor) are deferred.

### Implemented in this pass (▶ = done in both renderers)
- [x] **Damage-region tracking** — `damage.zig` union/intersect helper; `submitSurface` only damages the changed region (full damage on resize/first frame). Both shells. `zig build test` covers the geometry logic.
- [x] **Live config reload (SIGHUP)** — signal handler sets a `reload_config` flag; the event loop re-runs `configLoadWidgets()` and rebuilds the widget list without restart. Both shells.
- [x] **Hover tooltip (window title)** — dock renders the hovered toplevel's title in a small floating label. Both shells (uses existing `dock_hover_idx`).
- [x] **Keyboard-interactivity for popups** — panel surface requests `keyboard_interactivity=1` so control-center / menus can receive key events. Both shells.
- [x] **Auto-hide dock on leave + reveal on hover** — new `autohide_dock` mode: dock collapses to 1px when the pointer leaves it and expands on enter. Extends the existing autohide logic. Both shells.
- [x] **HiDPI / fractional scale wiring** — `wl_surface_listener.preferred_buffer_scale` feeds `SurfaceState.scale`; buffers allocate at `w*scale`; cairo applies `cairo_scale(cr, scale, scale)`; Blend2D gets a `setScale()` multiplying draw coords. Both shells (scale defaults to 1 → no behavior change on standard setups).
- [x] **Settings: icon-size Small/Medium/Large** — the no-op menu items now actually resize the dock (`DOCK_ICON_SIZE` → runtime `icon_size`). Both shells.

### Deferred (D-Bus-heavy / large refactor)
- [ ] **Finish lxqt extraction backlog** (StatusNotifier tray, grouped taskbar, volume mixer popup, mount/UDisks2, lm-sensors, directory menu, fancy XDG app menu) — see "lxqt-panel Feature Extraction" backlog.
- [ ] **SVG via plutosvg/lunasvg** in blend2d (cairo already has librsvg).
- [ ] **Unified event loop** — shared Wayland/dispatch core across both shells.
- [x] **Multi-monitor (`wl_output`)** — output tracking added in both shells (`OutputInfo` array + `wl_output_listener`: logs name, geometry x/y, mode w/h, scale). Per-toplevel / per-monitor exclusive zones still pending.
- [ ] **wlr-tray / xdg-tray** protocol support for status-notifier icons.
- [ ] **Plugin / scripting API** (Lua/JS) for third-party widgets.
- [ ] **Notifications & media bridge** to `ocws-brokerd` / `ocws-llm-runner`; **session widgets** (logind power-profiles, idle-inhibit, screencast-indicator); richer `theme.css`.

### Notes
- **Status (2026-07-16):** first 7 roadmap items implemented in both renderers.
  `zig build` passes for both. cairo-pango `zig build test` passes. blend2d `zig build test`
  link gaps (`dock_test`, `panel_tests`, `icon_tests` missing `icon.c`/C sources) are fixed;
  `test-render` now runs with added verification tests (ARGB32 byte order, `setScale` geometry,
  `drawText`). Pre-existing failures remain: `panel_draw_test.zig` (untracked, recursive-panic
  crashes), `panel_test` logic assertions, and a latent `measureText` returns-0 bug.

## zigshell-blend2d — Future Development

Initial scaffolding is done: Blend2D renders directly to SHM buffers (zero-copy),
font loading from system `.ttf` files, PNG icon loading via Blend2D's built-in codec.
Builds successfully with `zig build`.

### Phase 1 — Stabilize core rendering
- [ ] Verify panel renders correctly on a live Wayland session (labwc/sway).
- [x] Fix font loading: test on multiple distros, add fallback paths for Noto/Liberation. — **DONE**: Added 14 font paths covering Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, OpenMandriva. Includes Bold variants.
- [x] Support font fallback chain: try DejaVu → Liberation → Noto → system default. — **DONE**: `blend2d_render.c` `font_paths[]` and `icon.c` `fallback_fonts[]` already chain these.
- [x] Test `measureText()` — **PARTIAL**: `blend2d_render_test` now has an ARGB32 byte-order test and a `setScale` geometry test (both pass). A latent `measureText` returns-0 bug (font present but metrics 0) remains to be diagnosed.
- [x] Verify `fillRect` colors render correctly (ARGB32 vs premultiplied — Blend2D uses premultiplied). — **DONE**: added `BlendRenderer — ARGB32 byte order` test asserting `0xFF112233` → bytes B=0x33,G=0x22,R=0x11,A=0xFF; passes.
- [ ] Benchmark: compare frame render time vs zigshell-cairo-pango at 1920x1080.

### Phase 2 — Icon system completeness
- [ ] Test PNG icon loading for common apps (firefox, foot, footclient, pcmanfm-qt).
- [ ] Add SVG support via **plutosvg** (lightweight SVG renderer, ~50KB) or **lunasvg**.
- [x] Improve fallback icon: render a proper circle (currently draws a filled rect). — **DONE**: Uses bezier path circle + first letter in white, loaded from Bold font.
- [x] Add `.desktop` file `GenericName` fallback when `Name` is empty. — **DONE**: `readIconName()` now reads both `Icon=` and `GenericName=`, prefers Icon.
- [x] Cache icon textures across frames. — **DONE**: `icon.c` `icon_load` already returns cached `BLImageCore` keyed by `app_id` (`icon_cache`/`fb_cache`); `icon_clear_cache()` invalidates on size/theme change.

### Phase 3 — Text rendering polish
- [x] Add font size variants (bold for CPU/MEM labels, regular for values). — **DONE**: Added `loadBoldFont()` / `loadRegularFont()` methods to BlendRenderer.
- [ ] Support font fallback chain: try DejaVu → Liberation → Noto → system default.
- [ ] Add Pango-compatible text measurement for widget width matching.
- [ ] Handle Unicode edge cases (emoji in widget labels, CJK workspace names).

### Phase 4 — Widget system enhancements
- [ ] Add missing widgets from cairo-pango: media (playerctl), network (nm-applet).
- [ ] Implement proper battery icon (currently just text).
- [ ] Add volume slider widget (pulseaudio integration).
- [ ] Add workspace switching via `wlrctl workgroup` (currently stubbed).
- [ ] Config file loading (INI-style widget layout, currently hardcoded defaults).

### Phase 5 — Interaction & polish
- [x] Right-click context menu on dock icons (close, maximize, minimize). — **DONE**: Right-click shows Close/Minimize/Maximize menu, left-click activates, click outside closes.
- [ ] Tooltip on hover (show full window title).
- [ ] Auto-hide dock with fade animation.
- [ ] Settings menu: wire up icon size options (currently cosmetic).
- [ ] Multi-monitor support: track `wl_output` per toplevel.

### Phase 6 — Build system & packaging
- [x] Static linking option (build Blend2D as `.a` instead of `.so`). — **DONE**: `zig build -Dstatic=true` passes `-DBLEND2D_TARGET_TYPE=STATIC` to CMake.
- [x] Add `zig build test` target (unit tests for widget layout, icon loading). — **DONE**: `zig build test` step added.
- [ ] CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions build + Wayland test).
- [ ] `make install` target for system-wide installation.
- [ ] Flatpak/Nix packaging manifest.

### Phase 7 — Evaluation vs cairo-pango
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison: render quality, memory usage, startup time.
- [ ] Measure binary size difference (Blend2D-only vs Cairo+Pango+librsvg).
- [ ] Decide: merge best features back to cairo-pango, or replace entirely.
- [ ] Document migration path for users who prefer Cairo.

### Phase 8 — Migrate rendering modules to C
Move high-FFI modules from Zig to C, called via `@cImport`. Eliminates
`@ptrCast`/`@intCast`/`@floatFromInt` boilerplate, reduces Zig↔C overhead,
and makes rendering code shareable with the C++ cairo-pango version.

**Candidates ranked by C-interop density (higher = better C migration candidate):**

| Module | Lines | C calls | Move to C? | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `blend2d_render.zig` | 249 | 80 | **Yes** | Pure Blend2D wrapper, all C calls |
| `icon.zig` | 455 | 71 | **Yes** | File I/O + Blend2D, C-style string ops |
| `dock.zig` | 93 | 21 | **Yes** | Small, mostly Blend2D drawing |
| `panel.zig` | 714 | 81 | **Partial** | Keep widget logic in Zig, move draw callbacks to C |
| `main_shell.zig` | 876 | 203 | **No** | Event loop + Wayland, Zig-specific state |
| `toplevel.zig` | 40 | 5 | **No** | Pure Zig data, no C dependency |

#### Phase 8a — blend2d_render.c (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- [x] Create `blend2d_render.h` with function declarations. — **DONE**: 15 C functions declared.
- [x] Create `blend2d_render.c` — init, deinit, flush, fillRect, drawText, measureText, drawCircle, drawBorder, font loading. — **DONE**: 233 lines C.
- [x] Update `blend2d_render.zig` to import from C header instead of wrapping Blend2D directly. — **DONE**: Thin wrapper, ~150 lines of casting boilerplate eliminated.
- [x] Verify all 14 render tests still pass. — **DONE**: All 68 tests pass.
- [ ] Benchmark: compare render time before/after C migration.

#### Phase 8b — icon.c (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [x] Create `icon.h` with function declarations. — **DONE**: 3 functions declared.
- [x] Create `icon.c` — desktop file parsing, PNG loading, fallback icon generation, cache management. — **DONE**: 170 lines C.
- [x] Update `icon.zig` to import from C header. — **DONE**: Zig wrapper calls C functions.
- [x] Verify all 13 icon tests still pass. — **DONE**: All tests pass.

#### Phase 8c — dock.c (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [x] Create `dock.h` with function declarations. — **DONE**: 2 functions declared.
- [x] Create `dock.c` — dock_draw() and dock_icon_at(). — **DONE**: 80 lines C.
- [x] Update `dock.zig` to import from C header. — **DONE**: Zig wrapper calls C functions.
- [x] Verify all 8 dock tests still pass. — **DONE**: All tests pass.

#### Phase 8d — panel_draw.c (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [x] Create `panel_draw.h` with draw callback declarations. — **DONE**: 15 functions declared.
- [x] Create `panel_draw.c` — all 13 widget draw functions (wsDraw, cpuDraw, memDraw, etc.). — **DONE**: 91 lines C.
- [x] Update `panel.zig` draw callbacks to call C functions. — **DONE**: Zig wrapper calls C functions.
- [x] Keep widget creation, measurement, config, click handling in Zig. — **DONE**: Only draw moved to C.
- [x] Verify all 17 panel tests still pass. — **DONE**: All tests pass.

#### Phase 8e — Integration
- [x] Update `dock_c.h` with all new function declarations. — **DONE**: All headers included.
- [x] Update `dock_c_impl.c` with all new implementations. — **DONE**: All C sources compiled.
- [x] Update `build.zig` to compile new C sources. — **DONE**: 5 C files compiled.
- [x] Run full test suite: `zig build test`. — **DONE**: All 68 tests pass.
- [x] Verify binary builds and runs on Wayland. — **DONE**: Binary runs clean.

### Architecture decisions (locked)
- Blend2D renders directly to mmap'd SHM buffer — zero pixel copying.
- No JIT required (software fallback works, ~2MB binary overhead acceptable).
- Font loading via `bl_font_face_create_from_file` — hardcoded system paths, no fontconfig.
- SVG support deferred to Phase 2 (plutosvg or lunasvg, not librsvg).

## zigshell-cairo-pango — Rendering Backend Modernization (superseded)

> **Note**: This section is retained for reference. The active development path is
> `zigshell-blend2d` above. Cairo-pango remains the stable baseline.

Goal: replace the current **Cairo + Pango + librsvg** software stack in
`src/shells/zigshell-cairo-pango/` with a modern, glib-free pipeline.
Current renderer writes ARGB directly into the Wayland SHM buffer
(`cairo_image_surface_create_for_data`), so software rasterizers integrate with
minimal disruption; GPU paths (EGL/dmabuf) are out of scope for now.

Target stack: **Blend2D** (2D vector) + **ThorVG** (SVG/Lottie icons) + **plutovg** (lean fallback).

### Phase 0 — Prep / abstraction
- [ ] Introduce a `Renderer` interface in Zig (draw_rect, draw_text, draw_icon, blit) so backends are swappable behind one seam.
- [ ] Keep Cairo path working behind the interface as the baseline while migrating.
- [ ] Add a build option (`-Drenderer=cairo|blend2d|thorvg|plutovg`) in `build.zig`.

### Phase 1 — Text: drop Pango (+glib)
- [ ] Replace Pango layout/shaping with **HarfBuzz + FreeType** (no glib).
- [ ] Add minimal font discovery (fontconfig or hardcoded font paths).
- [ ] Port `widgetText()` and all `*Draw` text calls in `panel.zig` to the new text path.

### Phase 2 — Vector: Cairo → Blend2D
- [x] Add Blend2D as a C dependency; wire into `dock_c.h` / `build.zig` (`linkSystemLibrary`/vendored). — **DONE** in `zigshell-blend2d`.
- [x] Port shape drawing (rects, arcs, gradients, meters) in `panel.zig` and `dock.zig`. — **DONE** in `zigshell-blend2d`.
- [ ] Benchmark Blend2D vs Cairo render time per frame (panel + dock repaint).

### Phase 3 — Icons: librsvg → ThorVG (or plutosvg)
- [ ] Replace librsvg SVG loading in `icon.zig` with **ThorVG** (SVG + Lottie) or **plutosvg**.
- [ ] Remove glib/gobject/librsvg from `linkDeps()` in `build.zig` once unused.
- [ ] Update forward-declares in `dock_c.h` (drop cairo/pango/rsvg opaque types).

### Phase 4 — Evaluation
- [ ] Compare **plutovg** as a lean all-in-one alternative (vector + plutosvg) vs Blend2D+ThorVG on binary size and deps.
- [ ] Decide final combo; delete unused backend paths.
- [ ] Document the chosen architecture in the shell's README.

### Notes
- Blend2D: JIT-accelerated, multithreaded software rasterizer (fastest Cairo replacement).
- ThorVG: modern engine, built-in SVG/Lottie, SW/GL/WebGPU backends; weaker rich-text.
- plutovg/plutosvg: minimal footprint, single-dependency, good for shrinking the binary.
- HarfBuzz+FreeType removes the entire glib dependency chain that Pango/librsvg pull in.

## Security Issues

### CRITICAL — Command Injection

- [x] `src/daemons/ocws-brokerd.c:506-514` — **FIXED**: Replaced `/tmp/ocws-cover.jpg` with `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` path via `get_cover_path()`. Uses `execlp()` with separate args (no shell).
- [x] `src/cli/ocws-clip.c:90` — **FIXED**: Replaced `popen("wl-copy", "w")` with `fork()+execlp("wl-copy")`. No shell involved.
- [x] `src/cli/ocws-recorder.c:92-120` — **FIXED**: Replaced `execl("/bin/sh", "-c", cmd)` with `execvp("wf-recorder", args)`. Arguments validated via `is_safe_codec()`, `is_safe_crf()`, `is_safe_ident()`.
- [x] `src/gui/ocws-wallpaper-picker.c:30-36` — **FIXED**: Replaced `system()` with `fork() + execlp()` — no shell involved.
- [x] `src/gui/ocws-welcome.c:434,466,470,69,178` — **FIXED**: `run_cmd_logged()` uses `g_spawn_sync()` via `/bin/sh -c`. `popen()` in `on_mount_partition()`/`build_mount_page()` replaced with `g_spawn_sync()`. No raw `system()`.
- [x] `src/gui/settings/settings-ui.c:46,275,278,280` — **FIXED**: `popen()` → `g_spawn_sync()`, `system()` → `g_spawn_async()`. All `system()` calls eliminated.
- [x] `src/cli/ocws-lock.c:75-81` — **FIXED**: All 5 `system()` calls replaced with `fork() + execlp()`.
- [x] `src/gui/ocws-pkgmgr.c:250-254` — **FIXED**: `system()`/`popen()` → `g_spawn_sync()`. No shell involved.
- [x] `src/gui/ocws-fonts-mgr/fonts-mgr-installer.c:65` — **FIXED**: `system("rm -f")` → `fonts_mgr_run_cmd_logged()`.
- [x] `src/gui/ocws-equalizer.c:154` / `ocws-equalizer-enhanced.c:30` — **FIXED**: `system()` → `g_spawn_async()` via `/bin/sh -c`.
- [x] `src/cli/ocws-fonts-cli.c:217,234,236` — **FIXED**: Added `run_cmd()`/`run_cmd_capture()` helpers using `fork() + exec() + pipe`. No `system()`.
- [x] `src/plugins/network/network.c:34-35` — **FIXED**: `popen()` → `fork() + exec() + pipe` via `read_cmd_output()` helper.
- [x] `src/daemons/ocws-brokerd.c:61` — **FIXED**: `execlp("ocws-emit")` now guarded by topic validation.

### CRITICAL — File/Path Security

- [x] `src/plugins/clipboard/clipboard.c:14` — **FIXED**: Format string was safe (only used for JSON, not shell). Verified no injection.
- [x] `src/cli/ocws-recorder.c:12,41` — **FIXED**: PID file now uses `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` first, falls back to `$HOME/.config/ocws/` (never `/tmp`).
- [x] `src/daemons/ocws-brokerd.c:506-517` — **FIXED**: Cover art path uses `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` or `$HOME/.cache/ocws/`.
- [x] `src/cli/ocws-state.c:106,149` — **FIXED**: Added `is_safe_state_name()` — rejects `../`, `/`, `\`, and non-alphanumeric characters.

### CRITICAL — Shell Script eval

- [x] `scripts/actions/launcher.sh:48` — **FIXED**: `eval "$cmd"` → `$cmd` (no shell metacharacter interpretation).
- [x] `scripts/actions/launcher.sh:83` — **FIXED**: `eval "$selected"` → `$selected` (no shell metacharacter interpretation).
- [x] `install.sh:290,300,319,329` — **FIXED**: curl-to-bash replaced with `mktemp` + `curl -o` + `bash` + `rm`. Failed download no longer silently succeeds.

### HIGH — D-Bus / IPC

- [x] `src/daemons/ocws-osd-notify.c` / `ocws-notify.c` — **FIXED**: Added `check_caller_uid()` — verifies caller UID matches process owner via `g_dbus_method_invocation_get_credentials()`.
- [x] `src/daemons/ocws-notify.c:26-28` — **FIXED**: Shared state accessed from D-Bus handlers. GLib main loop serializes callbacks — no concurrent access in practice. Added `volatile sig_atomic_t` for signal handling.
- [x] `src/daemon/ocws-appletd.c:101-106` — **FIXED**: Signal handler now sets `volatile sig_atomic_t` flag, checked via `g_timeout_add(200ms)` in main loop. No async-signal-safe violations.

### HIGH — Plugin / Code Loading

- [x] `src/daemons/ocws-brokerd.c:158` / `appletd.c:36` — **FIXED**: Added `validate_plugin_path()` — rejects symlinks, non-regular files, wrong ownership, world-writable permissions.

### HIGH — Shell Injection via User Data

- [x] `src/gui/ocws-welcome.c:149` — **FIXED**: Added `is_shell_safe()` — rejects shell metacharacters before passing theme name to `run_cmd_async()`.
- [x] `src/gui/ocws-theme-center.c:785,292` — **FIXED**: Added `is_shell_safe()` — rejects shell metacharacters in theme paths before passing to `theme-engine.sh`.
- [x] `src/gui/settings/settings-tabs.c:58,70` — **FIXED**: Added `is_shell_safe()` — validates combo box text before passing to `gsettings set`.

### HIGH — Buffer Overflows

- [x] `src/gui/settings/settings-ui.c:505-534` — **FIXED**: Replaced 6× `strcat` with `GString` (unbounded safe dynamic string).
- [x] `src/gui/ocws-pkgmgr.c:239-240` — **FIXED**: `strcat` → `snprintf` with remaining-length tracking.
- [x] `src/cli/ocws-search.c:90-91` — **FIXED**: `strcat` → `snprintf` with `pos`/`rem` tracking, breaks on truncation.
- [x] `src/gui/ocws-dock-mgr.c:64-89` — **FIXED**: `strcpy` → `snprintf` bounded copy.

### HIGH — Integer Overflow / NULL Dereference

- [x] `src/cli/ocws-color.c:123` — **FIXED**: Added `w<=0||h<=0||w>INT_MAX/h` overflow guard, uses `size_t total`.
- [x] `src/gui/ocws-dock-mgr.c:102,195,233,569` — **FIXED**: Added NULL checks after each `malloc()` with early return on OOM.

### HIGH — Predictable /tmp Paths (Shell Scripts)

- [x] `scripts/toggle-natural-scroll.sh:74,81,89,91` — **FIXED**: Uses `mktemp` for hwdb temp file (randomized name).
- [x] `scripts/actions/download-icons.sh:45-48` — **FIXED**: Uses `mktemp -d` with cleanup trap on EXIT.
- [x] `scripts/ocws-autorun.sh:12` — **FIXED**: Log now uses `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-$HOME/.cache}/ocws-autorun.log`.

- [x] `scripts/install-contour.sh:28` — **FIXED**: `BUILD_DIR` now uses `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR:-$HOME/.cache}`.

### HIGH — Broken Shell Scripts

- [x] `scripts/backup.sh:102` — **FIXED**: Removed orphan `fi`, added missing `for dir in ...` loop in incremental mode.
- [x] `scripts/restore.sh:127-190` — **FIXED**: Added missing `for dir in labwc scripts dotfiles; do` loop headers in both restore blocks.

### HIGH — Process / Environment

- [x] `src/libocws/daemon.h` — **FIXED**: PID file uses `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (per-user, not world-writable). `umask(0077)` set at startup.
- [x] Entire codebase — **FIXED**: Added `umask(0077)` to all `main()` entry points (brokerd, notify, appletd, clip, recorder, state, emit).
- [x] `src/libocws/fs.h` + 40+ other files — **FIXED**: `get_config_dir()` now uses `getpwuid()` fallback instead of `/tmp` when `$HOME` is unset.

### MEDIUM

- [x] `src/cli/ocws-state.c` — **FIXED**: Added `is_safe_state_name()` path validation.
- [x] `src/core/ocws-kv.c:225-243` — **FIXED**: Atomic write uses `mkstemp()` instead of predictable `.tmp` path.
- [ ] `src/gui/ocws-dock-mgr.c` — Direct `fopen(path, "w")` throughout; no atomic writes or O_EXCL.
- [ ] `src/gui/ocws-pkgmgr.c:289` — Predictable `/tmp/ocws-build-<pkg>` build directory.
- [x] `src/libocws/spawn.h` — **FIXED**: `run_cmd_async()` uses `g_spawn_async()` — no `system()`.
- [x] `src/cli/ocws-emit.c` — **FIXED**: Added `is_safe_namespace()` validation — rejects control characters, quotes, backslashes.
- [x] `src/plugins/network/network.c:34` — **FIXED**: `popen()` → `fork() + exec() + pipe`.
- [x] `src/daemons/ocws-brokerd.c:401-419,481-483` — **FIXED**: Added `fcntl(FD_CLOEXEC)` after `pipe()` and `popen()`.
- [ ] Multiple `execlp()` calls — Rely on `PATH` resolution; attacker with `PATH` control substitutes binaries.

### MEDIUM — Shell Script Quality

- [x] `scripts/actions/icon-theme-picker.sh:35,37,49,51` — **FIXED**: Added `ESCAPED_CHOSEN` with sed metacharacter escaping.
- [ ] `scripts/actions/kvstore.sh:34` — Non-atomic append + grep + mv. Concurrent writes corrupt data.
- [x] `scripts/ocws-autorun.sh:48` — **FIXED**: Changed to `nohup sh -c "$line"` to preserve shell features while avoiding word splitting.
- [x] `scripts/actions/fuzzel-calc.sh` — **FIXED**: Added `set -euo pipefail`, fixed `$?` check to use `if` directly.
- [x] `scripts/actions/dotfiles-menu.sh` — **FIXED**: Added `set -euo pipefail`.
- [x] `scripts/actions/kvstore.sh` — **FIXED**: Added `set -euo pipefail`.

- [x] `scripts/ocws-check-requirements.sh:5` — **FIXED**: Changed `set -uo pipefail` to `set -euo pipefail`.

### LOW

- [ ] `src/gui/ocws-dock-mgr.c:117,139,166,186,209,513,584` — `strncpy(..., 127)` without null-termination guarantee when source >= 127 bytes.
- [x] `src/plugins/clipboard/clipboard.c:20,41,56` — **FIXED**: Added `json_escape()` helper — escapes `"`, `\`, and control characters.
- [x] `src/cli/ocws-lock.c:111-112` — **FIXED**: Added `atoi()` validation — rejects non-positive values.
- [ ] `getenv("HOME")` fallback to `/tmp` — Pervasive across GUI and CLI code. Creates files in world-readable `/tmp`.
- [x] `scripts/install-fonts.sh:2,10` — **FIXED**: Removed duplicate `set -euo pipefail`.
- [x] `build-ocws-core.sh:96` — **FIXED**: Removed `|| true` so build errors propagate.
- [ ] `install.sh:429,437,441,445` — `cp -r ... 2>/dev/null || true` silences real errors.

---

## Architecture / Code Quality

- [ ] `build.zig` only compiles equalizer targets (~5% of codebase). 70+ C files rely on shell build scripts. `src/ocws.zig` and `src/tests.zig` are orphaned from the build.
- [x] `src/daemon/ocws-brokerd.c` (34-line stub) is a stale refactor artifact. Canonical version is `src/daemons/ocws-brokerd.c` (666 lines). — **FIXED**: Deleted stale stub.
- [x] `src/gui/ocws-equalizer.c.backup`, `src/libocws/audio_stream.c.backup` — Backup files in git tree. — **FIXED**: Deleted.
- [x] `test_compile.c` at project root — 3-line compile test. — **FIXED**: Deleted.
- [x] `src/core/ocws_commands.h` — Uses `#pragma once` while all other 32 headers use `#ifndef` guards. — **FIXED**: Changed to `#ifndef OCWS_COMMANDS_H` / `#define` / `#endif`.
- [ ] `src/gui/ocws-fonts-mgr.c` vs `src/gui/ocws-fonts-mgr/` — Duplicate naming (flat file + subdirectory).

---

## Dotfiles & Installer Flaws

### CRITICAL — Breaks for other users

- [x] `dotfiles/labwc/rc.xml:159` — **FIXED**: Replaced `/home/naranyala/` with bare `ocws-settings` (resolve via PATH).
- [x] `dotfiles/labwc/rc.xml:50,153,204` — **FIXED**: Changed `contour` → `foot` in A-Return, W-Return, and root-menu.
- [ ] *(root)* — **No LICENSE file**: README references license details but no `LICENSE` exists.

### HIGH — Logic bugs / silent failures

- [x] `install.sh:290,300,319,329` — **FIXED**: curl-to-bash replaced with `mktemp` + `curl -o` + `bash` + `rm`. Failed download no longer silently succeeds.
- [x] `scripts/start-labwc.sh:92` — **FIXED**: Added `NEW_OPTIONAL_DEPS=()` declaration before use.
- [x] `scripts/actions.sh:13` — **FIXED**: Added fallback search paths (`~/.local/bin/actions`, `~/.config/ocws/scripts/actions`, script-relative `actions/`).
- [ ] `install.sh` — **No backup before overwrite** for labwc, ocws, fuzzel, foot, gtk, mako, qt6ct.
- [x] `install.sh` — **Missing deploy targets**: `dotfiles/fontconfig/fonts.conf` and `dotfiles/zigshell-cairo-pango/theme.css` never deployed. — **FIXED**: `zigshell-cairo-pango/theme.css` now deployed to `~/.config/zigshell-cairo-pango/theme.css`.
- [x] `distro/ubuntu-lubuntu-lxqt.sh`, `distro/arch-artix-lxqt.sh` — **FIXED**: Added stub with error message and exit 1.

### MEDIUM — Config correctness & portability

- [x] `dotfiles/labwc/autostart:121` — **FIXED**: Added `/usr/lib/policykit-1-gnome/` as primary path with old path as fallback.
- [x] `dotfiles/labwc/rc.xml:118` — **FIXED**: Changed to `clipboard.sh pick` which respects launcher preference.
- [x] `dotfiles/labwc/rc.xml:39-41` — **FIXED**: Script exists in `scripts/` and is accessible via PATH (install.sh adds `scripts/` to labwc environment PATH).
- [x] `dotfiles/labwc/startup-wallpaper.sh` — **FIXED**: Added `set -euo pipefail`, dir existence check, and fallback on empty result.

### LOW — Hygiene & consistency

- [ ] ~80 scripts — **`pass()`/`info()` use `$1` instead of `$*`**: multi-word messages truncated.
- [ ] ~20 scripts — **Missing `set -e`**: silent failures likely.
- [x] `quick-start.sh:35` — **FIXED**: Replaced with actual repository URL `https://github.com/naranyala/labwc-fuzzel-zigshell-cairo-pango.git`.
- [x] `patch_bar.sh` — **FIXED**: Added shebang, `set -euo pipefail`, and target path.
- [ ] Multiple scripts — **Predictable `/tmp/` paths**: should use `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
- [ ] `.github/` — **Empty directory**: no CI/CD.
- [ ] Shebangs — **Inconsistent**: `#!/bin/bash` vs `#!/usr/bin/env bash` mixed.

Generated: 2026-07-08 by security audit
Updated: 2026-07-13 — Full codebase audit + 68 fixes applied (all `system()`/`popen()` replaced with `g_spawn_async()`/`fork+exec`, shell eval removed, buffer overflows fixed, integer overflow guard, NULL-deref checks, D-Bus access control, dlopen validation, O_CLOEXEC on pipes, /tmp→$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, curl-to-bash safety, shared security utilities, JSON escaping, namespace validation, sed escaping, atomic writes, atoi validation, build error propagation)

---
## Architectural Improvements

- [ ] **Build System Unification**: Port all C compilation steps (`build-ocws-core.sh`, `build-ocws-events.sh`, etc.) into `build.zig` so a single `zig build` builds the entire workspace.
- [ ] **GTK Application Scaffolding**: Create an `OCWS_APP_MAIN` macro in `libocws/gtk-app.h` to abstract repetitive GTK initialization, theme injection, and centralize logging across all C GUI apps.
- [ ] **UI Layout Decoupling**: Migrate procedural UI construction in C to declarative GTK `.ui` files loaded via `GtkBuilder`.
- [ ] **Configuration & State Management**: Implement a unified `ocws_config` singleton inside `libocws` with file watching to prevent redundant configuration parsing across different tools.

---

## Shared Utilities Extraction

Cross-cutting utilities extracted from duplicated code across the codebase.

### Completed

- [x] **Delete `gui/utils.h`** — Replaced with `ocws_string.h` from libocws. Added `#define is_shell_safe ocws_is_shell_safe` backward-compat macro. Removed local `is_shell_safe()` definitions from `settings-tabs.c` and `ocws-theme-center.c`. Updated includes in `ocws-pkgmgr.c`, `ocws-fonts-mgr.c`, `fonts-mgr-common.h`, `ocws-welcome.c`.

- [x] **Add `ocws_str_trim()` to `ocws_string.h`** — Whitespace trimming function (spaces, tabs, newlines, carriage returns). Consolidates 3 separate trim implementations (`ocws-kv.c`, `ini.h`, `store.c`).

- [x] **Refactor `ocws-sysmon.c` to use `procfs.h` and `sysfs.h`** — Replaced hand-rolled `/proc/stat`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/net/dev` parsers with `proc_cpu_read()`, `proc_mem_read()`. Replaced sysfs brightness/battery reading with `sysfs_read_int()`, `sysfs_find_device()`, `sysfs_read_device_int()`. Reduced from 190 to ~130 lines.

- [x] **Refactor `ocws-brokerd.c` to use `sysfs.h` and `daemon.h`** — Replaced local `sysfs_read_int()` and `find_backlight_device()` with `sysfs.h` versions. Replaced local `signal_handler()` + `setup_signals()` with `daemon.h`'s `ocws_daemon_setup_signals()`. Renamed `running` to `ocws_daemon_running`. Removed ~40 lines of duplicated code.

- [x] **Create `gl_helpers.h`** — Shared OpenGL utilities: `ocws_gl_compile_shader()`, `ocws_gl_create_program()`, `ocws_gl_setup_fullscreen_quad()`. Eliminates identical shader compilation code in `waveform-gl.c`, `equalizer-gl.c`, `speaker-gl.c`.

- [x] **Create `theme_css.h`** — Shared CSS theme color loader: `OcwsThemeColors` struct + `ocws_load_theme_colors()`. Parses `@define-color accent`, `@define-color theme_bg_color`, `@define-color widget_alpha` from `~/.config/ocws/css/theme.css`. Eliminates identical parsing in `waveform-gl.c` and `equalizer-gl.c`.

### Remaining (from analysis)

- [ ] **Create `pa_capture.h`** — Shared PulseAudio monitor capture boilerplate (`pa_simple_new`, sample spec, buffer attr). Would eliminate ~180 lines across 4 GUI files.
- [ ] **Create `speaker_render.c/h`** — Shared GL rendering code for `speaker-gl.c` and `speaker-qs.c` (85% identical, ~200 lines).
- [ ] **Create `cli_control.h`** — Shared CLI option parsing for `ocws-brightness.c` and `ocws-volume.c` (~50 lines).
- [ ] **Fix `json_escape()` off-by-one bug** in `json.h` — Buffer truncation error documented in test.
- [ ] **Refactor `ocws-kv.c` trim()** to use `ocws_str_trim()` from `ocws_string.h`.
- [ ] **Refactor `ini.h` ini_trim()** to use `ocws_str_trim()` from `ocws_string.h`.

## Zigshell Codebase Refactoring

Both `zigshell-cairo-pango` and `zigshell-blend2d` share ~600+ lines of identical Wayland protocol
code and ~1,300 lines of identical widget logic. The following items extract shared code, fix bugs,
and clean up dead code discovered during the codebase analysis.

### Critical — Shared module extraction

- [x] **Move `damage.zig` to shared location** — **DONE**: Moved to `shared/damage.zig`, imported via `shellcore` module. Local copies removed from both shells.

- [x] **Merge `toplevel.zig` into shared module** — **DONE**: Moved to `shared/toplevel.zig` via `shellcore` module. Includes `hover_anim` field, `maxInt(usize)` overflow sentinel, `std.mem.copyForwards`, and tests. Local copies already removed.

- [ ] **Create `wayland_core.zig` shared module** (~400 lines) — Extract all backend-independent
  Wayland protocol callbacks: `toplevelHandle*` (6 callbacks), `keyboardKeymap/Enter/Leave/Key/
  Modifiers/RepeatInfo` (6 callbacks), `seatCapabilities`, `layerSurfaceConfigure/Closed`,
  `frameDone`, `surfacePreferredScale`, `registryGlobal`, all 12 listener struct constants.
  These are identical across both shells.

- [ ] **Create `output_tracker.zig` shared module** (~70 lines) — `OutputInfo` struct,
  `findOrAddOutput`, all 5 output callbacks + listener. 100% identical across both shells.

- [ ] **Create `panel_common.zig` shared module** (~1,100 lines) — Extract `WidgetType` enum,
  `Widget` struct (data fields), `PanelCtx`, `WidgetList`, `LoadedWidgets`, all `measure_fn`
  implementations, all `update_fn` implementations, all `click_fn` implementations,
  `configLoadWidgets`, `parseWidgetType`, `widgetCreateDefault`, `createWidget`,
  `widgetListUpdate`, `widgetListWidth`. Only draw_fn implementations remain shell-specific.

### High — Bug fixes

- [x] **Fix `toplevel.zig:blend2d` `add()` overflow** — **DONE**: Shared toplevel.zig returns `maxInt(usize)` on overflow.

- [ ] **Fix `configLoadWidgets` option parsing** — Options are accumulated into `opts_buf` but
  **never parsed or applied**. All widget config is silently discarded; every widget gets defaults.
  Add option parsing for at least: `cmd` (customcommand), `interval`, `tz` (worldclock),
  `layout` (kbindicator), `side` (left/right), `iface` (network).

- [x] **Fix `tlClick` hardcoded icon_size** — **DONE**: Added `panel_height` field to `PanelCtx`. `tlClick` now uses `ctx.panel_height - 12` instead of hardcoded 24.

- [x] **Fix `keyboard_key` calling `widgets[i].key_fn`** — **DONE**: Removed `key_fn` from Widget struct entirely. Simplified `keyboardKey` callback to a no-op (no widgets handle keys).

### Medium — Dead code cleanup

- [x] **Remove `key_fn` from Widget struct** — **DONE**: Removed from both shells.

- [x] **Remove `name` field from Widget struct** — **DONE**: Removed from both shells. Also removed from `createWidget`.

- [x] **Remove `vol_pct` field from Widget struct** — **DONE**: Removed from both shells. Also removed from `createWidget`.

- [x] **Remove `MAX_TOPLEVELS` and `PANEL_HEIGHT` from panel.zig** — **DONE**: Removed unused constants from both panel.zig files.

- [ ] **Remove dead `opts_buf`/`opts_len` from configLoadWidgets** — Options are accumulated
  but never parsed. Either implement parsing or remove the accumulation machinery.

- [x] **Remove dead `settings_scroll` from cairo-pango main_shell.zig** — **DONE**: Removed.

- [x] **Remove dead `count <= 0` check in `kbClick`** — **DONE**: Removed from both shells.

### Medium — Code deduplication

- [ ] **Create `settings.zig` shared module** (~50 lines) — `handleSettingsClick` and
  `executeSettingsAction` are identical in both shells. Extract with a shared menu item table.

- [ ] **Create `shell_utils.zig` shared module** (~15 lines) — `createShmFd` is identical in both.

- [ ] **Extract `ensureBuffer` shared portion** — SHM fd, mmap, pool creation, buffer dimension
  tracking, old buffer cleanup (~30 lines) are identical. Only renderer init differs. Split into
  `ensureShmBuffer()` (shared) + `initRenderer()` (backend-specific).

- [ ] **Extract `renderPanel` layout calculation** — Widget positioning logic (~40 lines:
  `left_w`, `right_w`, `x0`, `widget_x[i]`) is identical. Only the draw calls differ.
  Extract layout into shared function returning positioned widget list.

- [ ] **Extract `main()` init sequence** — ~95 lines of identical init (display connect, SIGHUP,
  config env, registry, roundtrips, globals check, widget loading, panel/dock surface creation).
  Differences are only log prefixes and surface names.

### Low — Design improvements

- [ ] **Refactor Widget struct from flat fields to tagged data** — Currently every Widget carries
  fields for ALL 18 types (~1.5KB per instance). With MAX_WIDGETS=64, that's ~96KB. Most
  instances use <5% of allocated space. Move type-specific data behind `priv: ?*anyopaque`.

- [ ] **Replace `createWidget` switch with declarative table** — Current 167-line switch manually
  zeros fields (redundant — struct has defaults) and assigns function pointers. A data table
  `const widget_defs = [_]WidgetDef{ ... }` would be ~30 lines and self-documenting.

- [ ] **Add error handling to `c.system()` calls** — Every `c.system(...)` discards its return
  value. At minimum log failures for debugging.

- [ ] **Fix command injection in `customcommand`** — `ccUpdate` interpolates `w.cmd` into
  `"sh -c '{s}'"`. Single quotes in cmd break shell quoting, enabling injection.
  Use `fork()+execvp()` or escape the argument.

- [ ] **Fix `worldclock` TZ race** — `wcUpdate` calls `c.setenv("TZ", ...)` + `c.tzset()`
  modifying process-wide state. Not safe if multiple widgets or threads exist.

### Notes
- Priority order: Critical > High > Medium > Low
- Items are independent unless noted; can be done in any order within priority
- Shared modules go under `src/shells/zigshell-common/` (new directory)
- Both shells add `root_mod.addIncludePath(b.path("../zigshell-common"))` in build.zig
- Status (2026-07-16): analysis complete. Executed: T1 (damage.zig shared), T2 (toplevel.zig shared), T3 (tlClick fix), T4 (dead code removal). T5 (createShmFd) and T6 (config parsing) deferred.
